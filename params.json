Tables can come in that are not completely clean or standard, so sometimes we need to do some thinking to clean up and prepare tables however we like.\r\n\r\nTabulaPasta tries to interpret your tables and then output an object which can be tossed into a Handlebars.js template or something similar to create a DataTable on the fly.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nYou can call TabulaPasta onto a string by using\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n###Detection Of Row Grouping\r\n\r\nTabulaPasta can detect some forms of row grouping and prepare the columns accordingly. For example, if you have something like this:\r\n\r\n- All Bob Businesses\r\n\r\n-  --Bob's Auto Repair\r\n\r\n-  --Bob's Home Repair\r\n\r\n-  --Bob's Relationship Repair\r\n\r\nTabulaPasta will create an invisible right column that will group these elements together by the parent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of, say, something chunked like:\r\n\r\n- BOB'S AUTO PROFITS\r\n- 2013\r\n- 2012\r\n- 2011\r\n- ----\r\n- BOB'S RELATIONSHIP PROFITS\r\n- 2013\r\n- 2012\r\n- 2011\r\n\r\nTabulaPasta can detect those two and create two invisible columns so you can correctly sort within chunks without a problem.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
